# I couldn't apply any funtion but promise I will learn :(
#BONUS PART YAAYY
#If  result of the correlation is negative we can say that there is a negative relation between  datas.
#If the result of the correlation is positive we can say that there is a positive relationship between data.
#However, I think that  there cannot be any relationship because They are different cities and they cannot affect each other.
